# SwiftUIHelpers

A Swift package that includes an integrated collection SwiftUI extensions and related custom
abstractions

## Overview

SwiftUIHelpers is a Swift package designed to complement SwiftUI, Apple’s native framework for
building user interfaces.  While SwiftUI provides a powerful declarative syntax for constructing and
customizing app UIs, SwiftUIHelpers builds upon this foundation with additional utilities and
abstractions to handle recurring tasks and enhance developer productivity.

This package focuses on providing practical, reusable extensions and abstractions that:

* Simplify common patterns in SwiftUI.
* Standardize customizations like gradients, shadows, and colors.
* Extend SwiftUI’s capabilities without overriding or replacing its native functionality.

By integrating SwiftUIHelpers into your project, you can reduce boilerplate code, improve
readability, and adopt reusable patterns tailored for modern SwiftUI apps.

## Features

* Convenient Extensions for SwiftUI:
  * Add reusable modifiers, conditional styles, and adaptive UI patterns.
* Custom Abstractions:
  * Encapsulate complex properties like shadows, gradients, and colors.
* Simplified Initializers:
  * Easily create SwiftUI `Color` instances from hex codes with alpha support.
* Enhanced View Modifiers:
  * Apply card styles, adaptive backgrounds, programmatic navigation, and more.
* *Computed Properties:
  * Extract RGB(A) components from `Color`.
