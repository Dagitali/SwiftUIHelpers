# A GitHub Actions workflow file that automates releasing software projects
# using GitFlow, where one has a `develop` branch for continuous development
# and a `main` (production) branch that would automatically deploy to
# production.  In between that, a `release` branch is created from `develop` to
# perform release preparation tasks before being merged to `main`.
# Occasionally, a `hotfix` branch is created from `main` for hot fixes.
#
# GitFlow itself is also an opinionated feature-based Git branching model with:
#
# * 2 long-running branches:
#   1. `develop`: For continuous development
#   2. `main`: For automatically deploying to production
#
# * Short-lived branches in between with enforced prefix conventions:
#   1. `bugfix/`:
#      * Created from the `develop` branch.
#      * Used to add/enhance/refactor features.
#      * Removed after merging to the `develop` branch.
#   2. `feature/`:
#      * Created from the `develop` branch.
#      * Used to add/enhance/refactor features.
#      * Removed after merging to the `develop` branch.
#   3. `hotfix/`:
#      * Created from the `main` branch.
#      * Used to create hot fixes (i.e., emergency software patches).
#      * Removed after merging to both the `main` and `develop` branches.
#   4. `release/`:
#      * Created from the `develop` branch.
#      * Used to perform release preparation tasks.
#      * Removed after merging to both the `main` and `develop` branches.
