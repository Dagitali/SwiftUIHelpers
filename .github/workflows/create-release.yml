# A GitHub Actions workflow file that automates part of the GitFlow workflow.
# Specifically, it:
#
# 1. Creates a GitHub pull request (PR) for the `release` branch.
# 2. "Freezes" (more or less) the `develop` branch for releases, although
#    other PRs can be merged to develop during the release branch lifetime
#    without affecting it.
#
# GitFlow itself is also an opinionated feature-based Git branching model with:
#
# * 2 long-running branches:
#   1. `develop`: For continuous development
#   2. `main`: For automatically deploying to production
#
# * Short-lived branches in between with enforced prefix conventions:
#   1. `feature/`:
#      * Created from the `develop` branch.
#      * Used to add/enhance/refactor features.
#      * Removed after merging to the `develop` branch.
#   2. `release/`:
#      * Created from the `develop` branch.
#      * Used to perform release preparation tasks.
#      * Removed after merging to both the `main` and `develop` branches.
#   3. `hotfix/`:
#      * Created from the `main` branch.
#      * Used to create hot fixes (i.e., emergency software patches).
#      * Removed after merging to both the `main` and `develop` branches.
